KAOS has slipped one of its agents into CONTROL's spy school, where they will learn all of CONTROL's secret techniques. Max poses as a student, and 99 as an employee, in order to root out the imposter. They have narrowed the suspects down to three suspicious students, but identifying the actual villain is proving to be more difficult than they expected.

This is more like it! Episode 3^[For Season 1, I will be referring to the episodes in DVD order, where the Pilot was listed as Episode 1.] is a tremendous improvement over Episode 2, both in the sharpness of the writing and in the lack of overt racism.

After a classic cold open (see "Best Joke of the Episode" below), we join Max as he's settling into his role as "Alexander Loomis," a trainee at CONTROL's training school for new agents. He's welcomed by Agents 99 and Fang, also undercover as a "Special Instructor"^[Agent 99's true name is an eternal mystery, but unlike Max and Fang, she isn't given an undercover name either. When she is confronted by one of the school's faculty, he calls her "Miss Whatever-Your-Name-Is"] and "Morris," respectively. During his tour of the school, he casually strolls past a series of wonderfully raucus and violent training exercises, with every trainee engaged in some sort of active shootout or hand-to-hand combat.

The bulk of the episode is Max attempting to rule out each of the three most likely suspects — all transfers from CONTROL's European division — until he can determine which one is the true infiltrator. When he is caught in the act of stealing classified documents from the school records room, he is forced to reveal his identity and mission to Hillary Gainsborough, a recent addition to the faculty from the London branch. Soon afterwards, an attempt is made on Max's life, which he foils by accident.

Utterly failing to make a connection between these two events, Max and 99 continue their investigation into the three suspects. When all of Max's efforts fail to eliminate even one of them, he attempts to lure the culprit into the open with a bluff: he announces that he will be revealing the identity of the infiltrator at a specific time and place later that evening.

The bluff does indeed lead to another assassination attempt, foiled by Fang, but the perpetrator's identity is not revealed. Finally, Max confronts all of the suspects in the same room in the presence of Gainsborough and the Dean, like a detective in a murder mystery. He accuses them one by one, completely absolving each of them to his growing frustration. Through process of elimination, and an extreme but lucky leap in logic, Max concludes that either the dean or Gainsborough must be the infiltrator, and picks Gainsborough at random. After a halfhearted protest, Gainsborough inexplicably confesses, just as Max is ready to give up and accuse the dean.

This episode succeeds on the strength of its barrage of successful gags, as well as Adams' always-impeccable comic timing. The story itself makes absolutely no sense, but that is normal for _Get Smart_. The story's absurd conclusion pairs appropriately with its absurd setup. Penalizing "School Days" for being nonsensical would be like dismissing a painting of a unicorn in outer space because there's no air in space^[But there is an [Air-in-Space Museum](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0701197/)].

## Best Joke of the Episode

> **Max:** (_Approaching a nondescript house_) Chief, I have to compliment you and the security boys, this place is a perfect front!
>
> (_Max rings the doorbell and a woman opens the door. He delivers the code phrase._)
>
> **Woman:** You must want the spy school. That's next door.

### Runner Up

> **Max:** (_To a British agent_) New, eh? And British? What was Micky Mantle's batting average in 1961?
>
> **Agent:** I, uh, don't know.
>
> **Max:** Correct — because if you _did_ know, you'd be American, not British!

## Notable Firsts

### Max and 99's mutual attraction

The previous episode had some interactions that _could_ have been interpreted as jealousy on the part of 99, but "School Days" is the first time we see it played out in its running gag form: when tensions are high and lives are at stake, Max and 99 lean into each other, stare into each other's eyes, and _almost_ touch their lips together before stopping abruptly.

How I feel about this gag varies from instance to instance. When done well, it's a keen spoof of how the same cliché is played completely straight in so many spy and adventure thrillers. When done poorly, it comes off as a joke at 99's expense, mocking her for her girlish crush on an undeserving buffoon. Its use in "School Days" is inoffensive but not particularly funny, so perhaps it's a good starting point for this nascent gag.

### Fang the Dog

It also marks the first appearance of Fang, the lovable canine agent whose handle is inexplicably and hilariously "K-13" when it could have easily been "K-9."

### "Would you believe…"

Max breaks out one of his most famous joke formulas for the first time in "School Days." If you've seen more than an episode or two of the show, you probably know it. It always follows the same pattern:

> **Max:** [_Some extraordinary claim._] Would you believe it?
>
> **Person:** I find that difficult to believe.
>
> **Max:** Would you believe [_slightly less extraordinary version of the claim._]?
>
> **Person:** No.
>
> **Max:** How about [_unimpressive version of the claim_]?
