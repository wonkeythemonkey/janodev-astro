A KAOS agent infiltrates CONTROL headquarters just before it's set to host a summit of the world's top scientific minds. Even worse, the agent has stolen a new CONTROL weapon that causes its targets to regress to the mind of an eight year old. It's up to Max and Agent 99 to track down the mole, recover the weapon, and put a stop to their evil plans.
