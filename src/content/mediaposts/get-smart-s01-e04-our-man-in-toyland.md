CONTROL has learned that KAOS is smuggling secret intelligence using a department store as a front. Despite their best efforts, they haven't been able to determine the exact method used to transmit the messages. Desperate to stop the leak before it leads to disaster, CONTROL deploys its top agents to infiltrate the store — but it seems that KAOS is on to them.
