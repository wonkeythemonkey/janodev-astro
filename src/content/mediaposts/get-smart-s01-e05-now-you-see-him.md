A missing scientist shows up at Max's home, only to be kidnapped by invisible KAOS agents. The agents threaten to sell their stolen invisibility ray to America's enemies unless CONTROL pays them $10 million. Max is tasked with confirming the ray's existence and making sure that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands â€” or at least wrong-er hands.
