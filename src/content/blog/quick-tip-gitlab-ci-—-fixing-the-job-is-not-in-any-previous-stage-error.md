## The Problem

I recently had a GitLab project with a failing [CI (continuous integration)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) pipeline. When I

```yaml
stages:
  - build-assets
  - build-wordpress

build:assets:
  stage: build-assets
  script:
    - docker-compose run asset-builder
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist
  only:
    - main
    - merge_requests

build:wordpress_theme:
  stage: build-wordpress
  before_script:
    - npm ci --omit=dev
  script:
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    name: "WordPress Themes"
    paths:
      - "themes_deploy"
  needs:
    - job: "build:assets"
      artifacts: true
```
