I loved watching Get Smart when I was a kid. The show was a few decades before my time, but thanks to Nick at Night and a few taped-from-television VHS tapes, I fell in love with the 1960s spy pastiche mixed with a blend of surreal and vaudevillian comedy. That wasn't how I would have explained it at the time, of course. I probably would have said that it was "really funny and had the guy who did the voice of Inspector Gadget."

When my Season 1 DVD set arrived, I sat down with my son to introduce him to this underappreciated gem. Saving the black-and-white pilot for later, I pressed play on the first "real" episode. My enthusiasm for the show lasted only a little longer than the opening credits before decaying into a deepening regret that I had exposed my child to it.

Before I go any further, I must reassure you that this review/recap series is not going to end with this entry. Neither will it be an endless recounting of the show's faults. The show has more highs than lows, even when its lows are egregious, and I intend to share both the good and the bad with you. But to equivocate on the racism, sexism, and doubtless other -isms on display would be a disservice to the people affected by them.

The episode begins in typical Get Smart fashion: nefarious spy business is afoot, and Smart ("Maxwell Smart, Agent 86," as he insists on announcing at the start of every phone call) receives his assignment from the chief through his shoe phone. This time, Max is having his shoes shined, and he has to ask the shoe shiner to switch feet so he can accept the call.

Max is ordered to return to CONTROL headquarters immediately, leading to the first dodgy moment of the episode: the man shining Max's shoes stands up and is revealed to be Asian. The actor, Bill Saito, is an American of Japanese descent, but the episode is content to identify him as "oriental" by way of the dissonant xylophone chords usually associated with China in American media.

Back at HQ, the Chief fills Max in on the situation: multiple young, blonde women have been abducted across the city, always with… _sigh_… "orientals" spotted in the vicinity. Max is being assigned to guard Princess Ingrid of Scandanavia, who matches the description of all of the other abductees, an## d is likely to be the next victim. A running gag during the briefing is that Max is constantly distracted by the photos of the beautiful women. Let me reiterate that these women Max is lusting over have all been kidnapped and are currently missing.

Incidentally, the most recent abduction occurred less than half a block away from Max as he received his phone call. This fact, which seems highly relevant, does not end up playing any role in the story whatsoever.

Max and Agent 99 meet up with the Pricess at her hotel, where they are spotted by the same spy from the first scene, along with the same musical identifier (in case you're really not paying attention and forgot that Asian people are supposed to be villains on this show). Max tells 99 that he and Ingrid have already met, when she was a "freckle-faced fifteen year old girl." Ingrid greets Max with a full, on the mouth kiss and suggests he take her back to his place, raising some uncomfortable questions about their past relationship.

From there, the setup is straight out of a P.G. Wodehouse story: Ingrid wants to take in the excitement and youth culture of the big, American city, while Max and 99 are determined to keep her out of danger by sticking to public, educational D.C. landmarks.

The rest of the plot is fairly unremarkable: Max inadvertently foils an assassination attempt on the Princess and pursues the assassin (the same man we've seen several times now) back to his base. After a pretty good sight gag involving a photo placed on the other side of a keyhole ("The old 'picture in the keyhole' trick. That's twice this month!"), Max comes face to face with the episode's principal villain: a notorious figure known as "The Claw" because of the magnetic claw he has in place of a hand.

This is where things get really bad vis-a-vis Asian representation. "The Claw" is played by American actor Leonard Strong. Credit where it's due: Strong does have at least some Asian ancestry, which is more than can be said for a lot of actors playing Asian characters at the time, but any goodwill earned there is more than offset by the phony accent, vaguely "Asian" costume, and portrait of George Washington with cartoonish slanted eyes. The whole caricature is topped off by a lazy and offensive running gag — Max is unable to get his head around The Claw's pronunciation of his own name, referring to him as "The Craw" throughout the rest of the episode.

Flanked by his henchman "Bobo" (played by Hawaiian actor Lee Kolima), The Claw explains that KAOS — for he is indeed an agent of KAOS — only really wanted Princess Ingrid, but they accidentally abducted the rest of the women because, "All Americans look alike to us."

It is difficult to explain why that joke was particularly galling to me, because in another context it _could_ have been a decent joke. It could have been used to flip the "All [fill in the blank] look alike" stereotype on its head, pointing out that white Americans do not have a monopoly on over-generalization. Instead, due to the show's absurdist tone and the abundance of lazy Asian stereotypes, the core of the joke seems to be that confusing one white person for another is a silly, perhaps stupid mistake — unlike when white people do it to Asian people, which has historically been treated as a natural and understanable mistake. This kind of joke frustrates me because providing context to explain why it is offensive takes work and patience, while ignoring context to defend it does not.

Also: Ingrid is not American. It's not the point of my rant, but come on.

Back in the plot, Max narrowly escapes The Claw and immediately encounters 99 — Princess Ingrid has run off and, by pure bad luck, chosen to go dancing at the very club that The Claw is using as a front for his operation. Max and 99 fight their way out of the club, dispatching the henchmen with wild dance moves (kids these days, with their Mashed Potatos and their Alligators, etc.), and immobilizing The Claw himself using his own magnet and a cart full of cutlery.

The episode wraps up in the Chief's office, ending with 99 teaching the Chief some of dance moves that the kids are doing these days.

I didn't know when I started this series that the first episode would be such an uncomfortable experience. As unpleasant as the episode was, it is useful to have an early warning. From the very start, I know that this particular grab-bag of goodies also contains live moustraps, and I won't go blundering into them unawares.

## Best Joke of the Episode

**Chief:** If you are captured and it looks really tough… this pill, when swallowed, will bring painless death in about twenty seconds. Are there any questions?

**Max:** How do I get them to take it?

### Runner Up

**Chief:** I've written the locations of your contacts on this piece of paper. Be sure to destroy it.

**Max:** Right, Chief. _(Proceeds to immediately burn the paper)_

**Chief:** No, no, no, Max! First memorize it, then destroy it!

## Notable Firsts

This episode gives us the first look at "The Lab," where Max is equipped with his high-tech spy gear before missions. The head scientist in this episode is a man named "Carlton," but based on my foggy, childhood recollections, this won't always be the case.

It also introduces Max's Shoe Phone, the most iconic piece of spy gear from the entire series. The exact design of the Shoe Phone would change over time, but even in this first episode it's an especially detailed and clever prop.
