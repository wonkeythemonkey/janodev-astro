description: The video streaming site Nebula has a lot of great channels. Here are some of my favorites.

I love YouTube videos, but I don't love YouTube. Lucky for me there is another way to watch some of my favorite YouTube creators without exposing myself to intense surveillance and relentless, algorithm-based suggestions.

I've been a Nebula subscriber since May 2021, about 2 years after the service launched and about three years before the writing of this article. In that time, it's become my preferred platform for finding and watching independently-produced videos. I still frequent YouTube to discover new channels and follow some that aren't part of Nebula, but one of the first things I do after smashing that subscribe button is check if they are also on Nebula.

If you are a new subscriber to Nebula, it's likely you joined because you liked the idea of watching one or two of your favorite YouTubers without ads, or maybe because they told you about some Nebula-exclusive content that you couldn't live without. Once you're there, though, it might be tricky to decide which of the more than 175 channels you want to check out next.

The following list is not meant to represent the "best" of Nebula. These are the channels that I currently watch and enjoy the most, and if you are like me (and I know I am), you might like them too.

## [Patrick (H) Willems](https://nebula.tv/patrickhwillems)

Patrick H. Willems deserves my first mention because he is the reason I subscribed to Nebula in the first place. His immaculately produced videos range in topic from best-of lists, to exhaustively researched career retrospectives, to short films of his own. The writing of the essays is insightful, with solid thematic throughlines that keep even seemingly dry topics interesting.

In 2019, Willems began framing all of his episodes with narrative segments. These segments related only loosely to the content of the essays, but collectively they told a continuing story that would come to be known as "The Charl Saga". The story ran until May 2021, when Willems announced that the series finale would be in the form of a full-length movie, and that it would be available exclusively on Nebula. I signed up immediately and never looked back — even though the movie took longer to make than Willems expected and didn't come out until the following June.

## [Hbomberguy](https://nebula.tv/hbomberguy)

In a certain corner of YouTube, and the internet in general, Hbomberguy needs no introduction. He first made a name for himself in the mid-2010s with videos debunking and hilariously mocking prominent alt-right YouTubers, and with provocative and unpopular — but well-argued — opinions about video games (for example: [Fallout 3 is Garbage (And Here's Why)](https://nebula.tv/videos/hbomberguy-fallout-3-is-garbage-and-here-s-why)).

Today, he is best known for his long form investigations into topics both important and trivial. His recent videos have gradually become longer and less frequent, with his latest being released more than a year after the previous video.

His videos are worth the wait. His latest, an exposé about plagiarism on YouTube, was so thorough and definitive that it ended the career of at least one famous YouTuber and seriously damaged a few others. That video was nearly 4 hours long, yet it held my attention for the entire run time (though I admit I had to watch it across several sittings).

### Recommended Hbomberguy Videos

- [Climate Denial: A Measured Response](https://nebula.tv/videos/hbomberguy-climate-denial-a-measured-response) — If you aren't ready to commit to a multi-hour epic just yet, this ironically titled video will give you a sense of Hbomberguy's style and substance in less than 45 minutes
