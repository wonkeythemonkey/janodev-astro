WordPress developer and educator Imran Siddiq recently posted an opinion piece called ["Some WordPress Creators Always Get the Love"](https://youtu.be/7xtW4R8-nrc?si=ZGF8qKDulC61jJ29) (approx. 10 minutes). In the video, he suggests that communities of WordPress creators — particularly blogger, YouTubers, and influential social media accounts — have formed cliques and echo chambers. Because of these echo chambers, he says, certain viewpoints dominate the landscape and others are excluded.

Here's how Siddiq describes it in his video ([shortcut to
this passage](https://youtu.be/7xtW4R8-nrc?si=LEBnnQyWn6GkRV3V&t=289)):

> What then happens is a few voices dominate. And it
> almost creates the illusion of this is
> the only way to use and work. There's
> one truth. If you don't speak that
> truth, you are false. You don't belong
> here. Where did you come from? We're the
> experts. We're the kingpins. We're the
> ones that tell people how to do it. We
> end up with this one source of truth and
> we don't want to acknowledge or take a
> step back and go, well, what do they
> think? And what about if we did consider
> another way of doing things? Do we
> always have to just follow one way of
> doing things? So eventually what can
> happen is that we have this huge market
> of talent, but only a few people stand
> out. the ones that are considered the
> gods, the lords, the experts, the
> ladies.

I believe that Siddiq was being thoughtful and sincere when he published his video, and I applaud him for sharing his genuine frustrations and concerns publicly and without malice. But that is not to say that I agree with him. I have a few key points of contention with his argument that I think are worth calling out. I also think that I can bring a different point of view to the discussion as someone who is (so far) just someone that uses and develops for WordPress sites, not someone with a popular blog or YouTube channel to defend.

The first issue I have with it is the idea that online communities with a narrow focus, like WordPress developer or content communities, are not obligated to spend their time discussing viewpoints that do not align with that community's interests. This was well addressed in two of the responses I've seen, one being Remkus de Vries' blog post ["The Fine Line Between Editorial Focus and Echo Chambers in WordPress"](https://remkusdevries.com/the-fine-line-between-editorial-focus-and-echo-chambers-in-wordpress/) and the other being Matt Medeiros' Matt Report podcast episode ["Yes, the WordPress echo chamber"](https://share.transistor.fm/s/f5cbedcb) (approx. 27 minutes).

There is one thing I have to add to this point. In his video, Siddiq says:

> So maybe people only want to promote Gutenberg
> and they want they don't want to consider other solutions.
> Maybe people want to promote a certain code snippet and don't
> promote or acknowledge that there's probably a plug-in. Maybe
> you only promote a certain plugin and you don't want to
> acknowledge there's a code snippet or another way to do it.
> Maybe you just want to promote CSS grid and you don't want to
> acknowledge that you could do it without using a CSS grid. So
> what happens is you all almost virtually sign up to a way of
> thinking and that's all you put out there.

If you applied this argument to other fields, it would clearly make little sense. For example, "Maybe people only want to write about Microsoft Windows and don't want to link out to articles explaining that you can also accomplish the same thing with MacOS or Linux." The difference between building a WordPress site with and without something like Elementor can be similar to the difference between operating systems, and "promoting" one way as an alternative to the other is only helpful if the topic is whether or not to install Elementor. The same goes for many other plugins and libraries that significantly change the way WordPress works.

I'm not sure what to say about the reference to people who "just want to promote CSS grid" and "don't want to acknowledge that you could do it without using a CSS grid." That would be a very strange mindset indeed, and I cannot think of any conflict of interest that would lead to a developer deliberately suppressing information about how to use alternative CSS properties.

The larger issue I have with Siddiq's video is exemplified by the first quote I included above; I believe that he is unintentionally falling prety to, or at least spreading, a dangerous "anti-expert" viewpoint that has already infected many areas of public life.

To explain what I mean, I need to define the difference between "consensus" and "orthodoxy." Consensus is an idea that has been shared, discussed, and generally agreed upon by a group. Orthodoxy is when a rule has been codified by leadership to dictate the only right way to do things.

While orthodoxy is seen as a positive thing in most religions, it is frowned upon in academic and scientific contexts.

Where Siddiq treads dangerously is where he conflates the two ideas without acknowledging that you can have consensus without orthodoxy.
